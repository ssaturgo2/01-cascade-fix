# 01-cascade-fix
This project, from The Odin Project's HTML Foundations course, is about fixing CSS problems caused by the **cascade** and **specificity**.

## Goal
*   Fix CSS styling issues by understanding how CSS rules are prioritized.

## Key Concepts
*   **CSS Specificity:** How CSS decides which rule wins (IDs are stronger than classes, etc.).
*   **CSS Cascade:** The order CSS rules are applied (later rules can override earlier ones).

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS
